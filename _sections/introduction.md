The Biological Observation Matrix format [1](https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-217X-1-7 "The Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) format or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the ome-ome") is widely used for a variety of -omics data.
It contains the counts along with metadata to both samples and observations in a single file.
One main purpose of the biom format is to enhance interoperability between different software suits.
Therefore it has been incorporated into QIIME, MG-RAST, PICRUSt, Mothur, phyloseq, MEGAN, VAMPS, metagenomeSeq, Phinch, RDP Classifier.
Libraries exist in python and R.
Challenges for web applications (v1 / v2), requirement of special fields (phinch), performance for representation (datatables).
Here we present ... a biojs module. (Principles of biojs)
