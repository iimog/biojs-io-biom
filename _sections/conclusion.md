The utility and versatility of biojs-io-biom has been demonstrated in two example applications.
It is implemented using latest web technologies, well tested and well documented.
It provides a unified interface and abstracts from details like version or internal data representation.
Therefore it will facilitate the development of web applications that use the biom format.
One of the next steps is the development of another biojs module to present biom data as a set of data tables.
In order to do that for large data sets sophisticated accession functions capitalizing on the sparse data representation
have to be implemented.
